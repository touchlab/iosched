Developers need better tools now, more than ever, and the number of third-party SDKs is also growing to meet the developer's needs. Unfortunately, many of these SDKs are poorly developed and extremely difficult to use. In fact, at Twitter on the Crashlytics team, we've detected a significant percentage of issues caused by third-party SDKs.<br /><br />Crashlytics is well-known for its focus on SDK quality, and have been deployed on hundreds of millions of devices. In this session, attendees will learn the skills to develop and distribute SDKs for Android. We'll explore how to design and build an SDK for stability, testability, performance, overall footprint size, and, most importantly, exceptional ease of implementation. Over the course of the session, we'll develop a simple but well-architected SDK and uncover and explain many of the challenges we encountered when building SDKs at Twitter. Topics include device feature detection, supporting multiple application types (from Widgets to Services to Foreground GUI applications), API design, deploying artifacts, and coding patterns to support developer customization. We'll conclude with advanced topics, from less-known but very useful tricks to minimizing impact on application start-up time to reducing memory footprint and persistent CPU use.","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356612/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4Poie","startTimestamp":"2014-09-20T19:30:00Z","title":"Building First Class Android SDKs","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-20T20:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5521","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP","TOPIC_ADVANCED","TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE"],"color":null,"mainTag":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","room":"c6bbd6c8"},{"speakers":[5677],"description":null,"photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1370078/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4Qlaf","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T14:10:00Z","title":"The Evolution of Mobile Advertising","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T14:50:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5537","tags":["THEME_BUSINESS"],"color":"#666666","room":"e16ec9a4"},{"speakers":[5664],"description":"A deep dive into what the Android internals consist of for both of these wearable device platforms.

With over a billion users regularly accessing the mobile app and site and numerous partners building upon the platform each day, there is a constant need to tackle performance issues associated with a platform of this scale. As such, Facebook has built a dedicated Android infrastructure team in New York focused on improving feed rendering and seamlessness of posts -- no easy feat when you consider the wide range of people, brands, and entities sharing content spanning text, video, photos, reshares, and more.<br /><br />In a continued effort to improve speed and reliability, Facebook&rsquo;s Android infrastructure engineers rewrote the feed rendering so stories are split into logical sections rather than as an entire single post. This design was inspired by problems exposed when trying to present a rich and diverse feed, such as a deep view hierarchy, poor scroll performance and testability.<br /><br />In this session, hear from Omer Strulovich, Software Engineer at Facebook New York, on how Facebook rethought the process for feed rendering on Android to result in a quicker, smoother scrolling experience for users, and improved developer velocity.
